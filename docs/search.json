    "text": "1.1 INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1.1 The Carbon cycle\nCarbon as water is also essential for life. It is the central element of organic molecules and in climate (\\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\)). The carbon cycle links the carbon in organic, atmospheric, oceanic, mantle and rocks. The resulting balance supports life and climate stability.\nDespite the luminosity of the sun increasing, the continents moving, ice age and warm periods occuring, life changing and oxygen appearing, the temperature of the Earth remained between 0\\(\\circ\\)C and 100\\(\\circ\\) C. The amount of \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) in the atmosphere is small compared to the carbon present in surface sediments as \\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\) and organic molecules. The key role in climate stability is the partitioning between \\(\\ce{CO2(g)}\\) and \\(\\ce{C(s)}\\).\n\n\n1.1.2 Reservoirs of carbon\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The Carbon cycle: Dynamics between carbon reservoirs.The fluxes are in GT per year.

Reservoirs for the inorganic carbon are: atmosphere, oceans, sediments and sedimentary rocks (limestone and dolostones).\nOceans are a key player in the system; they are sources as well as sinks for \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\). At equilibrium \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) flux from sources is balanced by sinks. However, when the equilibrium is disturbed like fossil fuels burning, most of the oceans are sinks for \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) (check how the tropical Pacific ocean behaves like a carbon source research.noaa.gov)."

How can you explain the locations of the carbon sinks and sources?\nWhat factors and how do they affect \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) solubility in water?\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Chemical weathering\nThe slightly acidic water reacts with crustal rock minerals like carbonates and silicates and cause weathering (carbonate weathering Equation 1.5 and silicate weathering Equation 1.6):\n\\[\n\\ce{CaCO3(s) + H2CO3(aq) -&gt; Ca^{2+} (aq)  + 2 HCO3- (aq)}\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\n\\[\n\\ce{CaSiO3(s) + 2 H2CO3(aq) -&gt; Ca^{2+} (aq)  + 2 HCO3- (aq) + SiO2(s) + H2O}\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\nAll the products are transported to rivers and then oceans. Most particulate materials are deposited near mouths of rivers in deltas, beaches, and near shores. The dissolved materials are distributed over the oceans.\n\nQuick Check 1.1 Does the concentration of salts in oceans increase versus time?\n\n\nSome of the calcium ions react with hydrogencarbonate to form calcium carbonate precipitate (Equation 1.7):\n\\[\n\\ce{ Ca^{2+} (aq)  + 2HCO3- (aq) -&gt; CaCO3(s) + H2CO3(aq) }\n\\tag{1.7}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Plankton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Corals\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: :Marine organisms produce solid \\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\) and use \\(\\ce{SiO2}\\) to form their shells and skeletons.

The precipitation of calcium carbonate (calcite and aragonite) is mainly done by organisms such as phytoplankton and zooplankton (corals make aragonite). \\(\\ce{SiO2}\\) is also used by plankton like diatom and radiolarian ( Figure 1.4).

Eventually, by seafloor spreading the sediments are carried to depth and buried. They become limestone reservoirs.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Silicate weathering net process\nCarbonate weathering Equation 1.5 is balanced out by carbonate precipitation Equation 1.7 and no net of \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) is produced. Silica weathering Equation 1.8 is combined only with carbonate precipitation Equation 1.9 and carbon dioxide in water Equation 1.10. The overall reaction Equation 1.11 shows a net conversion of atmospheric \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) to solid \\(\\ce{CaCO3(s)}\\) i.e. a net outflow of \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) from the atmosphere reservoir to the ocean.\n\\[\n\\ce{CaSiO_3(s)  + 2H2CO3(aq) -&gt; Ca^{2+}(aq)  + 2HCO3^-(aq) + SiO2(s) + H2O}\n\\tag{1.8}\\]\n\\[        \n\\ce{Ca^{2+} (aq) + 2 HCO3^-(aq) -&gt; CaCO3(s) + H2CO3(aq)}\n\\tag{1.9}\\]\n\\[\n\\ce{CO2 + H2O &lt;=&gt; H2CO3(aq)}\n\\tag{1.10}\\]\n\\[        \n\\ce {CaSiO_3(s) + CO2 -&gt; CaCO3(s)  + SiO2(s)}\n\\tag{1.11}\\]\nThe silicate weathering rate increases with temperature and with rain (water is the reaction medium).\nAlthough the conversion rate is small (0.03 Gton(C)/year), it is significant to cause carbon depletion in the atmosphere over one million years. This means there is a need for a return flux to the atmosphere: The carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle."

A negative feedback loop is a process that counteracts changes in a system, helping to maintain stability.

    "text": "2.1 INTRODUCTION\n\n2.1.1 THE ROLE OF EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE\nEarth’s atmosphere is a thin layer of gas that surrounds the planet, mainly composed of nitrogen and oxygen. How the atmosphere interacts and responds to the components of the different subsystems shows how interconnected the environment is. For example, heat differences in the atmosphere caused by varying amounts of sunlight received drives wind movement, affecting ocean currents and precipitation distribution. Volcanic outgassing from the geosphere supplies the atmosphere with trace gases and carbon from Earth’s interior. Life on Earth also modifies the composition of the atmosphere through respiration and photosynthesis. Hence, the atmosphere can be seen as a consequence of, and essential for, life (Lewis, 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Deeper Discussion\n\n\n\nThink about how the atmosphere interacts with the different subsystems of Earth: the Geosphere, the Hydrosphere, the Biosphere and others (eg. space).\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 EARTH’S STABLE CLIMATE\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Evidence of the past: Zircons\n\n\nThe current earliest evidence of liquid water existing on Earth dates back to 4.4 billion years ago and it is found in zircons. (Wilde et al., 2001) This suggests that Earth’s temperature has remained in a narrow range that supports liquid water despite various changes, such as in the Sun’s luminosity, throughout Earth’s history. Climate stabilisation is vital for the security and continuity of Earth’s inhabitants.\n\n\n2.1.3 SDG 13: CLIMATE ACTION\nIn recent years, a warming trend in the climate has drawn worldwide attention as it is proceeding at an unprecedented rate in Earth’s history. It is especially significant as it is unambiguously a by-product of anthropogenic development since the 20th century. Scientists have documented evidence of this phenomenon across the globe that revealed a climate that is shifting. (NASA, n.d.)\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Evidence of a changing climate. Adapted from NASA: Global Climate Change\n\n\nWhat’s concerning is how these changes have severely impacted our everyday lives. For example, extreme weather events have disrupted the provision of basic amenities such as water, sanitation and education in many countries, not to mention the large-scale infrastructure damages that follow these events. A change in global climate has also negatively impacted agricultural production and resulted in food security issues.\nUnder the push for global collaboration on sustainable development, the United Nations (UN) adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Goal 13: Climate action primarily aims to:\n\nImprove the resilience and adaptability of all countries to climate-related hazards.\nVitalize initiatives against climate change in national policies and planning.\nEmphasize education and develop institutional capacities on climate change resilience, adaptability, impact reduction and early warning."

    "text": "2.3 SIMPLE RADIATIVE EQUILIBRIUM WITH NO ATMOSPHERE\n\n2.3.1 Radiative equilibrium\nSince Earth’s temperature has been stable over a long geological time, Earth can be perceived to be in a state of radiative equilibrium. It is a state in which the total thermal radiation received by the object is equivalent to the total thermal radiation being emitted. In short, the flow of incoming energy = the flow of outgoing energy (Figure 3). Using this assumption, we can calculate the effective temperature of a planet at radiative equilibrium.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Incoming solar radiation (left) and outgoing Earth radiation (right)\n\n\nAlthough the energy of the geosphere is significant (44 TW), the most important source of energy originates from the Sun (Incoming energy). The received energy then excites atoms and molecules on Earth, raising the temperature of the corresponding material and results in thermal infrared energy radiated (Outgoing energy). Let’s now have a look at how we will be calculating the amount of energy received and emitted by a planet.\n\n\n2.3.2 BLACKBODY RADIATION\nWe can use the concept of blackbody radiation to model the Sun and also the Earth’s flow of energy. A blackbody refers to a model system which absorbs all incident electromagnetic radiation and for it to remain in thermal equilibrium, it must emit radiation as well (blackbody radiation). The blackbody emission spectrum depends on the temperature of the object and follows Planck’s law, Wien’s law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nPlanck’s Law\nPlanck’s law shows the electromagnetic spectral distribution of the radiation coming from a blackbody at a specific temperature in thermal equilibrium.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: (Left) Blackbody emission spectra of an object with increasing temperature (3000K to 6000K). (Right) Blackbody emission spectra of the Sun and the Earth\n\n\n\n\nWien’s Law\nWien’s law gives you the relationship between the wavelength of the maximum emission and the temperature of the blackbody object.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{1}\n\\lambda_{max} = \\frac{2898}{T}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTo find the wavelength (\\(\\lambda_{max}\\), \\(\\mu m\\)) of the maximum emission, divide 2898 by the temperature (\\(T\\),\\(K\\)).\n\n\nStefan-Boltzmann Law\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann Law gives you the flux of energy (the rate of transfer of energy per unit area) emitted by the blackbody object (\\(F\\)) at a specific temperature (for a perfect blackbody we have):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{2}\nF = \\sigma T^{4}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe flux (\\(F\\), \\(W m^{-2}\\)) emitted is the product of the temperature (\\(T\\), \\(K\\)) of the blackbody and the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (\\(\\sigma = 5.67 \\times 10^{-8} W m^{-2} K^{-4}\\)).\n\n\nCalculation of flux received at the surface of a planet\nTo calculate the amount of flux received on the surface of a planet from the star \\(S_{0}\\), we have to utilise the inverse square law (Figure 5). It says that the energy density is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source, while the total energy emitted from the source is constant.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Illustration of energy dispersion through the inverse square law.\n\n\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{3}\n\\frac{F}{S_{0}} = \\frac{R_{p}^{2}}{r_{s}^{2}}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe ratio between the flux emitted from the surface of the sun (\\(F\\), \\(W m^{-2}\\)) and the flux received on a planet (\\(S_{0}\\), \\(W m^{-2}\\)) equals the ratio between the square of the planet’s distance from the sun (\\(R_{p}\\), \\(m\\)) and the square of the Sun’s radius (\\(r_{s}\\), \\(m\\)).\n\n\n\n2.3.3 ALBEDO\nNot all the light from the Sun is received by a planet, with one part being reflected off. The amount reflected depends on the albedo of the surface \\(\\alpha\\) (Table 2).\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{4}\nS_0' = S_0\\alpha\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe flux reflected by the planet (\\(S_0'\\), \\(W m^{-2}\\)) is the product of the flux received by the planet (\\(S_0\\), \\(W m^{-2}\\)) and its albedo (\\(\\alpha\\)).\nTable 2: Albedo of various surfaces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE OF A PLANET\nWe are now able to calculate the effective temperature of a planet at radiative equilibrium. The planet absorbs the energy from the Sun (Solar flux, \\(S_0\\)) and emits radiation as a blackbody (Planet flux, \\(F_p\\)). The albedo (\\(\\alpha\\)) is the fraction of light being reflected.\nTo convert flux to energy, we have to multiply it by its effective surface area (Figure 6). A planet intercepts incoming solar flux with its cross-sectional area \\(\\pi R^2\\).

    "text": "2.4 ONE-LAYER MODEL\n\n2.4.1 GREENHOUSE GASES\nFrom the results of M3, a difference between the temperature modelled using your code and the actual temperature measured can be observed. This is because the simple radiative equilibrium model does not take planetary atmosphere into consideration. Although present in very small amounts in the atmosphere, some gases have a great impact on Earth’s temperature. They are called greenhouse gases.\nThe greenhouse effect is the trapping of infra-red radiation by gases, resulting in an increase of the surface temperature. Infra-red active molecules show a change in their dipole moment (permanent dipole is not necessary) during vibration as seen in Figure 7.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Molecular vibrations of N2, O2, CO2 and H2O. You can view the animations here.\n\n\nGreenhouse gases absorb the infra-red radiation emitted by the solid Earth and re-emit them back into the atmosphere. Figure 8 shows how much infra-red radiation emitted from the Earth is re-absorbed by the atmosphere. In particular, we can take note of the absorption bands of water and carbon dioxide.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: The amount of greenhouse gas IR-absorption is shown in green and the Earth blackbody emitted radiation is shown in orange.\n\n\nFor M3, Venus has a thick atmosphere that is primarily comprised of CO2 (around 96.5%). Hence, its strong greenhouse effect on Venus retains more heat in its atmosphere, resulting in the observed large temperature increment. In contrast, while Mars also has a predominantly CO2 atmosphere (around 95.32%), its atmosphere is really thin, and thus plays a relatively weak role in retaining heat. As such, the previous model can provide a close approximation to Mars’ temperature.\n\n\n2.4.2 ONE-LAYER MODEL\nThe one-layer model is a simple model to show the effect of the atmosphere on a planet’s temperature. Figure 9 shows the solar radiation \\(F_s\\) entering the atmosphere and only a fraction \\(\\tau_s\\) goes through and reaches the planet’s surface. Similarly, the flux emitted by the planet surface \\(F_g\\) comes out of the layer of atmosphere with a fraction \\(\\tau_g\\). The values for \\(\\tau_s\\) and \\(\\tau_g\\) are 0.8 and 0.1 respectively on Earth. Finally, \\(F_a\\) represents the radiation emitted by the atmosphere (also modelled as a blackbody).\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Left, One-layer model: \\(F_s\\), \\(F_g\\) and \\(F_a\\) are respectively the emission from the sun, the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere (with \\(\\tau_s\\) = 0.8 and \\(\\tau_g\\) = 0.1). Right, The blackbody emission spectrum of the sun and measured solar radiation before and after going through the atmosphere.\n\n\n\nWhat does \\(\\tau_s\\) and \\(\\tau_g\\) represent? Explain the difference in value.\n\n\nAssume there is a radiative equilibrium both at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface of the Earth (bottom of the atmosphere), derive an expression for the flux emitted from the ground (\\(F_g\\)) as a function of \\(F_s\\), \\(\\tau_s\\), \\(\\tau_g\\) (see Figure 9)\n\n\nFrom the previous simplified equation, derive the equation to calculate the effective temperature of the planet (\\(T_p\\)) with an atmosphere.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Modelling Questions\nM4. Construct a code and calculate the effective temperature of Earth with a simulated atmosphere of \\(\\tau_s\\) = 0.8 and \\(\\tau_g\\) = 0.1 and an average solar flux of \\(S_0\\)/4 and the albedo of the Earth."

    "section": "2.5 TEMPERATURE EVOLUTION MODEL",
    "text": "2.5 TEMPERATURE EVOLUTION MODEL\n\n2.5.1 EARTH AS A GREYBODY\nSo far, we have modelled the planet as a perfect blackbody and therefore the emitted flux Fg (\\(W m^{-2}\\)):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nF_{g} = \\epsilon\\sigma \\times  T^4 = \\sigma \\times T^4\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is the emissivity of the body. It varies from 0 (no emission) to 1 (perfect blackbody emission). A body with an emissivity less than 1 is called a greybody.\nFrom the one-layer model, we see that the atmosphere affects a planet’s surface temperature greatly through the introduction of \\(\\tau\\). Comparing it to the simple radiative equilibrium model which assumes the Earth as a perfect blackbody (\\(\\epsilon\\) = 1), we can find that it does not model well the real surface temperature.\nIn essence, due to the insulative blanket that the atmosphere causes, the emitted flux back to space will be lower. Hence, the emissivity of the body is lower and the surface temperature will be higher. By including the coefficient \\(\\epsilon\\), we can model better the real surface temperature. Note we cannot directly measure \\(\\epsilon\\), but we can adjust the value according to temperature and flux observations.\n\n\n2.5.2 TEMPERATURE LINEARISATION\nIn order to make the modelling easier, we’ll be doing temperature linearisation (possible because \\(T_c\\) = \\(\\pm\\) 20\\(^\\circ\\)C). Sellers (1969) and Budyko (1969) in the 60’s demonstrated that Earth’s energy emission could be written in a linear form with the temperature. Much later, it was proven to fit very well with energy flux observations.\nSince for small \\(x\\), we can write \\((1+x)^4 \\approx 1 + 4x\\)\n\\[T_K^4 = (T_0 + T_c)^4 = T_0^4 \\times (1 + \\frac{T_c}{T_0})^4 \\approx T_0^4 \\times (1+4\\frac{T_c}{T_0})\\]\nThe temperature in Kelvin (\\(T_K\\)), the 0\\(^\\circ\\)C in Kelvin (\\(T_0\\) = 273.15K) and temperature in Celcius (\\(T_c\\))\n\\[{T_K}^4 = {T_0}^4 + 4{T_0}^3 \\times T_c = a + bT_c\\]\nAs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are constants, we can simplify:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{6}\nF_g = \\epsilon\\sigma \\times {T_K}^4 = \\epsilon\\sigma(a + bT_c) = A + BT_c\n\\end{equation}\\]\nWith A (\\(W m^{-2}\\)) and B (\\(W m^{-2}\\) \\(^\\circ C^{-1}\\)) constants. A and B reflect the emissivity of the atmosphere. They will be given and they vary with the type of atmosphere (amount of greenhouse gases). More or less, the constants A and B can tell us the following:\nTable 3: Representation of the constants A and B\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can find in Table 4, different values reported in literature.\nTable 4: Values of A and B reported in literature\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Modelling Questions\nM5. Calculate the temperature of Earth using the constants from McGuffie (2005). Take note of the units of B!\n\n\n2.5.4 TEMPERATURE EVOLUTION MODEL\nIn this model, we are interested to find the change of temperature with time and find the equilibrium temperature of the planet as it reaches radiative equilibrium. We will be modelling Earth’s emission as written in 6.2 using the values for a greybody. The equations for Earth’s average energy gain (\\(E_{gain}\\)) and energy loss (\\(E_{loss}\\)) for this model would be:\n\\[E_{gain}(W/m^2) = \\frac{S_0 \\times (1-\\alpha)}{4}\\] \\[E_{loss} (W/m^2)= A + BT_c\\]\nThe absorption of heat of a body is controlled by the heat capacity (C). So, the difference between the energy gain and the energy loss of the Earth can be expressed:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{7}\nC \\times \\frac{dT}{dt} = E_{gain} - E_{loss}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nThe rate of heat flow (\\(\\frac{dT}{dt}\\)) is proportional to the difference between the energy gained and energy loss by Earth.\n\n\n2.5.5 Modelling Questions\nLet’s construct a code for a temperature evolution model that simulates how Earth’s temperature slowly equilibrates over time.\nM6. According to the rate of heat flow equation, what is the unit of the heat capacity (C)?\nCalculate Earth’s Heat Capacity (\\(C\\)) based on Earth’s water content. Given:\n Depth of water: \\(70\\) m  Density of water: \\(1.025 \\times 10^6\\) g/m\\(^3\\)  Heat capacity of water: \\(4.186\\) J/g\\(.\\)K  Ocean coverage: \\(0.7\\)\n\nM7. Calculate Earth’s average \\(E_{gain}\\) (Energy gain in Watts/m\\(^2\\)). Given:\n \\(S_0\\): 1370 Watts/m\\(^2\\)  Albedo: 0.32\n\nM8. Based on the final equation from 6.3, use the Euler method to simulate Earth’s temperature slowly equilibrating over time from a given initial temperature. After each iteration, store the temperature (T) and the time (t) in a list to be plotted at the end. Use the McGuffie A and B greybody constants.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some variables you can consider initializing at the start of the model:  Count: To keep track of the number of loops  Starting temperature (T_0): 255 K  Starting time (t_0): 0 seconds  Timestep or dt: 1 Year or 31536000 seconds  Two lists to store the time and temperature from each iteration\nYou may use the below flowchart to assist in your coding of the iteration loop. \nFinally, plot the data obtained."

Examples of tipping points often being discussed include the melting of the arctic sea ice, deforestation in the Amazon basin and widescale coral bleaching events.

Now, we will vary the albedo of the planet through the simulation of ice forming on the planet, which in turn is affected by the temperature.\nThis model takes into account the contribution of each latitude (surface area and local temperature) to calculate the average temperature of Earth.\nThe objectives are:\n\nGenerate the temperature data for a range of solar radiation (luminosity).\nPlot the graph T (temperature) against M (solar multiplier)\nExplain how the temperature change with the luminosity and why.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Ice-albedo model illustration when solar luminosity is decreasing.\n\n\n\n\n2.7.2 MODEL SET-UP\n\n(A) Energy gain\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Distribution of the solar flux across latitudes.\n\n\nWe divide the hemisphere in 10 bands of 9\\(^\\circ\\) latitude each (Figure 15). The area of each band (in fraction) and the local solar flux (\\(S_i\\)) is reported in Table 5.\nTable 5: Area and local solar flux received for each latitude bands.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the zonal insolation data (\\(S_i\\)) to calculate \\(F_{gain}\\) at each latitude band.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{8}\nF_{gain} = S_i \\times (1-\\alpha_i) \\times M\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n(B) Temperature\nLet’s define the average planet temperature as:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{9}\nT_{avg} = \\sum(area_i \\times T_i)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n(C) Energy loss from Earth\nThe energy emitted/lost at each latitude band is given by the local temperature (\\(T_i\\)) and the average temperature (\\(T_{avg}\\)):\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{10}\nF_{loss} = A + B \\times T_i + G \\times (T_i - T_{avg})\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\(G\\) represents heat transfer coefficient. \\(F_{loss}\\) at each latitude band is then calculated.\n\n\n\n2.7.3 LOCAL AND AVERAGE ALBEDO\nLet’s now find the local albedo (\\(\\alpha_i\\)). At each latitude band, the albedo is fixed at 0.3 (current Earth’s albedo) when the temperature is \\(\\ge -10^\\circ\\)C (critical T), otherwise it is 0.6 (ice albedo). The same way as the temperature, the average albedo of the planet is the sum of the area-weighted albedos.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{11}\n\\alpha_{average} = \\sum(area_i \\times \\alpha_i)\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\n\n2.7.4 EQUILIBRIUM STATES\nOur objective is to find the equilibrium average temperature of the planet for a specific solar luminosity (\\(T_{eq}\\) against \\(M\\)). In other words, how does the planet’s temperature change when the overall solar energy received changes.\nYou’ll need to find the average temperature (T) at equilibrium for the values of the solar multiplier (\\(M\\)) going from 0.6 to 1.4. First, run the model by increasing \\(M\\) (0.6 to 1.4) and then by decreasing \\(M\\) (1.4 to 0.6). Collect the equilibrium temperature for each solar multiplier.\n\\[F_{loss} = A + B \\times T_i + G \\times (T_i - T_{avg})\\] \\[F_{gain} = S_i \\times (1-\\alpha_i) \\times  M\\]\nAt equilibrium, \\(F_{gain} = F_{loss}\\)\n\\[F_{gain} = F_{loss} = A + B \\times T_i + G \\times (T_i - T_{avg})\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\tag{12}\nT_i = \\frac{F_{gain} - A + G \\times T_{avg}}{(B+G)}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nTo find the equilibrium average planet temperature (\\(T_{avg}\\)), you will start with an arbitrary condition (i.e. local temperature for each latitude band) and use the iteration method.\n\n\n2.7.5 INITIAL CONDITIONS\nThe solar constant is \\(S_0 \\times M\\) with \\(M\\) ranging from 0.6 to 1.4.\nYou will assume that it is the same initial temperature (\\(T_i\\) = 203K) at each latitude band (with \\(M\\) = 0.6). Therefore, all local albedos at the initial stage is equivalent to 0.6 (Earth is covered in ice).\nIn this model, you are tasked to model Earth’s temperature by changing \\(M\\) to simulate when solar radiation received increases (0.6 to 1.4) or decreases (1.4 to 0.6). Do note that following incremental changes in \\(M\\), the calculated equilibrium temperature from the previous iteration will then become the initial temperature for the next iteration.\n\n\n2.7.6 Modelling Questions\nLet’s construct a code to understand the ice-albedo model.\nYou are given two arrays containing the area of each band and its local solar flux:\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Array containing area of each band and its local solar flux\nArea = np.array([0.156434465, 0.152582529, 0.144973505, 0.133794753, 0.119321529, 0.101910213, 0.08198953, 0.060049992, 0.036631824, 0.012311659])\nS    = np.array([416.6480383, 406.3887808, 386.1228828, 356.349358, 317.8013293, 271.4279772, 218.3711674, 160.4091221, 112.7543514, 73.14499959])\n\n# Constants:\nG, A, B = 3.8, 204, 2.17\n\n\nM9. Initialize two arrays to store the modelled Earth’s bands of temperatures (T_0) and albedos(albedo_0). Have the planet first be -70\\(^\\circ\\)C throughout.\nRemember: The critical temperature is \\(-10^\\circ\\)C. The albedo is 0.3 when \\(T\\ge -10^\\circ\\)C and albedo is 0.6 when \\(T\\le -10^\\circ\\)C.\n\nM10. Understand and complete the flowchart of the ice-albedo model given below. \nM11. Based on the flowchart, construct the code to compute the ice-albedo model and plot the graphs for increasing and decreasing solar multiplier (\\(M\\)).\n\n\n2.7.7 Interpreting the graphical results\nThe ice-albedo model aims to relate the concept of feedback cycles and how they affect the surface temperature of the Earth to achieve equilibrium. Using previous questions, attempt to draw the feedback cycles when surface temperatures drops or when it rises. You’ll find that both feedback cycles show a positive feedback loop which magnifies the effects of the change in solar luminosity.\nThe ice-albedo model show how changes of the Earth’s polar ice caps can have huge effects on the entire planet’s climate. For more information, look into the supplementary materials on Earth’s paleoclimate.\n\nIllustrate two positive feedback loops when 1. surface temperatures drops and 2. when surface temperature rises incorporating the below factors:\n\nSurface temperature\nIce Cover\nEarth’s albedo\n\\(F_{gain}\\)\n\n\nHowever, why does the surface temperature trend go differently depending on the increasing or decreasing of the solar luminosity? This phenomenon is a hysteresis. Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its initial conditions. So, how were the initial conditions different that could help to explain the hysteresis observed in the graph plot of equilibrium temperature against \\(M\\)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Deeper Discussion\n\n\n\nWhy does the surface temperature trend go differently depending on the increasing or decreasing of the solar luminosity?"

Black daisies absorb more solar radiation, warming their local environment, while white daisies reflect more sunlight, contributing to local cooling. The growth rates of both types of daisies depend on the local temperature, creating a feedback loop: as daisies proliferate, they alter the planet’s albedo (reflectivity), which in turn modifies the overall planetary temperature. Over time, as daisies spread, the amount of available bare ground decreases. To build understanding, we will first examine a simplified model featuring only white (or black) daisies before extending our analysis to the full model with both black and white daisies through modelling exercises.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nWATSON, A.J. and LOVELOCK, J.E.

Relationship between the surface temperature of the planet and the white daisy coverage.\n\n\n\nWith reference to Figure 2, explain the parabolic response of the daisy coverage versus the planet’s temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Deeper Discussion\n\n\n\nIt is time to connect the dots:\n\nWhite Daisies:\n\nDescribe and illustrate two feedback loops that explain how the planet’s temperature changes in relation to the coverage of white daisies: one for temperatures below the optimal growth temperature for white daisies, and one for temperatures above this optimum.\n\nBlack Daisies:\n\nSimilarly, describe and illustrate two feedback loops for black daisies: one for temperatures below their optimal growth temperature, and one for temperatures above this optimum.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Equilibrium states in the daisyworld\n\nMutual Responses due to Couplings in the Daisyworld\nThe surface temperature of the planet is dependent on the characteristics of daisies growing on the planet [2]. For example, white daisies reflect more incoming solar radiation back into the atmosphere. This reduces the amount of incoming solar radiation absorbed by the available ground, which in turn, reduces the surface temperature of the planet.\nThe surface temperature response to daisy coverage in this negative coupling is implicitly implied by albedo, which reduces the capacity of the planet’s surface to take up solar flux [2]. On the other hand, white daisies possess a parabolic growth curve to do with the local temperature. As such, the abundance of white daisies will become optimal when it is at the optimum temperature but decreases to zero when the temperature goes to the two extremities. Local temperature is the condition that caps the population size of white daisies.\nHowever, with increasing luminosity and thus increasing surface temperatures, white daisies are no longer able to grow as quickly as before, as temperatures are beyond optimum temperatures (Figure 3). Hence, there will be a decrease in white daisy coverage over time, after the optimum surface temperature.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Relationship between white daisy coverage and surface temperature. The linear relationship represents response of temperature to the change of daisy coverage, whilst the parabolic relationship represents response of the daisy coverage to the change in temperature.\n\n\n\n\nWith the two coupling relationships overlaid, the intersection points of the plots of average surface temperature against daisy coverage and daisy coverage against average surface temperature (Figure 3) show the two possible equilibrium states. How the system will respond to perturbations will depend on the type of steady states the system is at.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. A visual representation of the types of steady states. (A) represents a stable steady state and (B) represents an unstable steady state.\n\n\n\nWe can refer to type of steady state as stable (Figure 4(A)), and unstable (Figure 4(B)). These are defined below [3]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStable steady state\nWhen displaced from its position, a net force will be experienced by the object in the opposing direction (restoring force).\n\n\nUnstable steady state\nWhen displaced from its position, a net force will be experienced by the object in the same direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Check 3.1  \n\nIf you move / push the ball away from A what happens ?\nIf the same was done with B, what happens ?\nUsing this analogy, explain what a stable and unstable steady state is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Deeper Discussion\n\n\n\n\nReferring back to Figure 3, how can you determine whether an equilibrium point (where the two curves intersect) is stable or unstable? What method or reasoning would you use to assess its stability?(hint: Cobweb)\nWhat is the difference between equilibrium and steady state? Provide specific examples from Daisyworld to illustrate when each concept applies."

    "text": "3.2 HOW DOES THE PLANET’S TEMPERATURE CHANGE WITH BLACK OR WHITE DAISIES?\nNow, we will proceed to develop a computer model based on the mathematical framework proposed by Lovelock and Watson. This model will help us explore the evolution of life and planetary temperature regulation. To start, we will construct a single-daisy model, examining white and black daisies separately before considering their interactions.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. An overview of the modelling scenarios.\n\n\nSee all the equations and constants in Section 3.8.\n\n3.2.1 PLOTTING DAISY COVERAGE AGAINST TIME\nLet us begin by first looking at how the daisy’s area changes with time. As we do not have a simple equation linking both variables, we will use the Euler’s method to determine a function of how the daisy’s area changes with time.\n\nEuler’s Method\n\nQuick Check 3.2 Do you remember Numerical Solutions?\n\nTheoretically, differential equations may be solved by separation of variables. However, in more complex equations, this may prove to be challenging. Instead, an alternative way to solve differential equations is used, that is, Euler’s method.\nEuler’s method makes use of the idea of linear approximation, which involves the use of tangent lines at the point of the solution curve to approximate the solution to the initial value problem (values of the parameters when \\(t = 0\\)).\n\n\n\nFigure 6. An illustration of linear approximation used in Euler’s method.\n\n\nEuler’s method is used to solve differential equations of the form :\n\\[{dy \\over dx} = f(t, y)\\]\nwith initial conditions:\n\\[ t = t_0, y(t_0) = y_0\\] \\[{ \\left.\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right|_{t_0, y_0} } = f(t_0, y_0)\\]\nIf we take a point close to \\(t_0\\) and call it \\(t_1\\), we can rewrite the equation as\n\\[ y_1 = y_0 + { \\left.\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right|_{t_0, y_0} } (t_1 - t_0) = y_0 + f(t_0, y_0) \\cdot \\Delta t \\]\nBy taking numerous values of t and substituting it into the equation, we can obtain a relationship between \\(y_n\\) and \\(y_{n+1}\\) and can then generalise the Euler’s method formula to be :\n\\[ y_{n+1} = y_n + f(t_n, y_n) \\cdot \\Delta t \\]\nApplying Euler to the Daisyworld model\n\nWhat equation (from Section 3.8) are you going to use to determine the area of the white daisies (\\(A_w\\)) versus time?\nApply the Euler method to express the equation:\n\n\\[A_{wn+1}=A_{wn}+\\Delta A_w \\] The increment \\(\\Delta A_w\\) is approximated from \\(dA_w\\) in the relevant differential equation. Express \\(\\Delta A_w\\) in terms of \\(dA_w\\). Find how to calculate \\(dA_w\\).\n\nGiven the initial value of the white daisies (\\(A_{w0}=0.01\\)), \\(dt=0.1\\) and the constants in Section 3.8 can you calculate the value of the daisies after one timestep (\\(A_{w1}\\))?\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Modelling Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM1\nCreate a loop that can help you generate the data (\\(A_{w1}, A_{w2}, A_{w_3}, ...\\)) for a specific number of timesteps (you may start with 50 iterations).\n\n\nM2\nPlot the graph of daisy coverage (\\(A_w\\)) against time (\\(t\\)) for white daisies.\n\n\nM3\nRepeat for black daisies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: You may find that referring to the white daisy feedback loop may help with understanding how to update the variables.\n\nDo you remember Loops?\n\n\n\n3.2.3 HOW DOES THE PLANET TEMPERATURE CHANGE WITH TIME?\nNow, we are interested in planet temperature. However, similar to daisy coverage, we do not have a direct simple equation that links the planet temperature with time. Identify the main equation in the paper that shows the change in temperature.\nLooking at the equation, what variable(s) are changing with time ?\n\n\n3.2.4 Modelling Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM4\nBy making small changes to the previous code, plot the planet temperature against time.\n\n\nM5\nVary the initial amount of white daisies (\\(A_{w0}\\)), can you reach a steady state for the planet temperature (\\(T_p\\)) without killing all the daisies ? If so, give the final steady state conditions (\\(T_p\\) and \\(A_w\\)). How many steady states can you find?\n\n\nM6\nRepeat with black daisies only\n\n\nM7\nNow compare the result of the two types of daisies (Temperature vs time and the change in daisy population vs time for the same luminosity), do they reach the same result? And behave the same way to moderate T? Explain."
