Appreciate Simple Models\n\nAppreciate the utility of simple models in simulating complex interactions within ecological systems.\nExplore their applications in real-world environmental studies.\n\n5. Understand Equilibrium Characteristics\n\nUnderstand the characteristics of equilibrium within the Daisyworld model.\nExamine how interactions between daisies and their environment can lead to a balanced state that supports planetary stability.\n\n\n\nPREAMBLE\nIn the basic Daisyworld model, we focus on two types of daisies—black and white—each exerting a distinct influence on the planet’s temperature. Black daisies absorb more solar radiation, warming their local environment, while white daisies reflect more sunlight, contributing to local cooling. The growth rates of both types of daisies depend on the local temperature, creating a feedback loop: as daisies proliferate, they alter the planet’s albedo (reflectivity), which in turn modifies the overall planetary temperature. Over time, as daisies spread, the amount of available bare ground decreases. To build understanding, we will first examine a simplified model featuring only white (or black) daisies before extending our analysis to the full model with both black and white daisies through modelling exercises.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nWATSON, A.J. and LOVELOCK, J.E.

    "text": "3.1 FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF DAISYWORLD\n\n3.1.1 SDG 11 : Sustainable cities and communities\nSDG 11 of the United National Sustainable Development Goals is to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable [1]. Human settlements are highly complex, involving different interactions between nature and man. However, by breaking down these systems into fundamental parts, we can study these interactions and the effects of changing biological or physical variables.\nStarting with a simplified Daisyworld model, we will delve into the effects of different environmental factors on the daisy growth, before looking into extending the model to study other factors.\n\n\n3.1.2 The daisyworld feedback loops\nLet’s start our investigation by understanding the relationship between the daisies and the the planet’s temperature.\n\nEffect of the Daisies on the Planet’s Temperature\nFirst let’s discuss how the change of daisies impact first the temperature of the planet.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Relationship between the white daisy coverage and the surface temperature of the planet.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3.1 With reference to Figure 1, answer the following questions.\n\nWhy does the number of white daisies affect the surface temperature in a negative, linear relationship ?\nWhat is the effect of black daisies on the temperature of the planet ?\nWhat are the differences between the roles of the black and white daisies in the model ?\nWhat do daisies, temperature luminosity, albedo in the Daisyworld represent in the actual biosphere ?\n\n\n\n\nEffect of Temperature on the Daisy’s Coverage\nJust as the colour of daisies influences the surface temperature, the temperature, in turn, affects daisy growth. Specifically, white daisies exhibit a parabolic growth response to changes in planetary temperature, with optimal growth occurring within a specific temperature range (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Relationship between the surface temperature of the planet and the white daisy coverage.\n\n\n\nWith reference to Figure 2, explain the parabolic response of the daisy coverage versus the planet’s temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Deeper Discussion\n\n\n\nIt is time to connect the dots:\n\nWhite Daisies:\n\nDescribe and illustrate two feedback loops that explain how the planet’s temperature changes in relation to the coverage of white daisies: one for temperatures below the optimal growth temperature for white daisies, and one for temperatures above this optimum.\n\nBlack Daisies:\n\nSimilarly, describe and illustrate two feedback loops for black daisies: one for temperatures below their optimal growth temperature, and one for temperatures above this optimum.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Equilibrium states in the daisyworld\n\nMutual Responses due to Couplings in the Daisyworld\nThe surface temperature of the planet is dependent on the characteristics of daisies growing on the planet [2]. For example, white daisies reflect more incoming solar radiation back into the atmosphere. This reduces the amount of incoming solar radiation absorbed by the available ground, which in turn, reduces the surface temperature of the planet.\nThe surface temperature response to daisy coverage in this negative coupling is implicitly implied by albedo, which reduces the capacity of the planet’s surface to take up solar flux [2]. On the other hand, white daisies possess a parabolic growth curve to do with the local temperature. As such, the abundance of white daisies will become optimal when it is at the optimum temperature but decreases to zero when the temperature goes to the two extremities. Local temperature is the condition that caps the population size of white daisies.\nHowever, with increasing luminosity and thus increasing surface temperatures, white daisies are no longer able to grow as quickly as before, as temperatures are beyond optimum temperatures (Figure 3). Hence, there will be a decrease in white daisy coverage over time, after the optimum surface temperature.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Relationship between white daisy coverage and surface temperature. The linear relationship represents response of temperature to the change of daisy coverage, whilst the parabolic relationship represents response of the daisy coverage to the change in temperature.\n\n\n\n\nWith the two coupling relationships overlaid, the intersection points of the plots of average surface temperature against daisy coverage and daisy coverage against average surface temperature (Figure 3) show the two possible equilibrium states. How the system will respond to perturbations will depend on the type of steady states the system is at.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. A visual representation of the types of steady states. (A) represents a stable steady state and (B) represents an unstable steady state.\n\n\n\nWe can refer to type of steady state as stable (Figure 4(A)), and unstable (Figure 4(B)). These are defined below [3]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStable steady state\nWhen displaced from its position, a net force will be experienced by the object in the opposing direction (restoring force).\n\n\nUnstable steady state\nWhen displaced from its position, a net force will be experienced by the object in the same direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Check 3.1  \n\nIf you move / push the ball away from A what happens ?\nIf the same was done with B, what happens ?\nUsing this analogy, explain what a stable and unstable steady state is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Deeper Discussion\n\n\n\n\nReferring back to Figure 3, how can you determine whether an equilibrium point (where the two curves intersect) is stable or unstable? What method or reasoning would you use to assess its stability?(hint: Cobweb)\nWhat is the difference between equilibrium and steady state? Provide specific examples from Daisyworld to illustrate when each concept applies."

    "text": "3.2 HOW DOES THE PLANET’S TEMPERATURE CHANGE WITH BLACK OR WHITE DAISIES?\nNow, we will proceed to develop a computer model based on the mathematical framework proposed by Lovelock and Watson. This model will help us explore the evolution of life and planetary temperature regulation. To start, we will construct a single-daisy model, examining white and black daisies separately before considering their interactions.\n\n\n\nFigure 5. An overview of the modelling scenarios.\n\n\nSee all the equations and constants in Section 3.8.\n\n3.2.1 PLOTTING DAISY COVERAGE AGAINST TIME\nLet us begin by first looking at how the daisy’s area changes with time. As we do not have a simple equation linking both variables, we will use the Euler’s method to determine a function of how the daisy’s area changes with time.\n\nEuler’s Method\n\nQuick Check 3.2 Do you remember Numerical Solutions?\n\nTheoretically, differential equations may be solved by separation of variables. However, in more complex equations, this may prove to be challenging. Instead, an alternative way to solve differential equations is used, that is, Euler’s method.\nEuler’s method makes use of the idea of linear approximation, which involves the use of tangent lines at the point of the solution curve to approximate the solution to the initial value problem (values of the parameters when \\(t = 0\\)).\n\n\n\nFigure 6. An illustration of linear approximation used in Euler’s method.\n\n\nEuler’s method is used to solve differential equations of the form :\n\\[{dy \\over dx} = f(t, y)\\]\nwith initial conditions:\n\\[ t = t_0, y(t_0) = y_0\\] \\[{ \\left.\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right|_{t_0, y_0} } = f(t_0, y_0)\\]\nIf we take a point close to \\(t_0\\) and call it \\(t_1\\), we can rewrite the equation as\n\\[ y_1 = y_0 + { \\left.\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right|_{t_0, y_0} } (t_1 - t_0) = y_0 + f(t_0, y_0) \\cdot \\Delta t \\]\nBy taking numerous values of t and substituting it into the equation, we can obtain a relationship between \\(y_n\\) and \\(y_{n+1}\\) and can then generalise the Euler’s method formula to be :\n\\[ y_{n+1} = y_n + f(t_n, y_n) \\cdot \\Delta t \\]\nApplying Euler to the Daisyworld model\n\nWhat equation (from Section 3.8) are you going to use to determine the area of the white daisies (\\(A_w\\)) versus time?\nApply the Euler method to express the equation:\n\n\\[A_{wn+1}=A_{wn}+\\Delta A_w \\] The increment \\(\\Delta A_w\\) is approximated from \\(dA_w\\) in the relevant differential equation. Express \\(\\Delta A_w\\) in terms of \\(dA_w\\). Find how to calculate \\(dA_w\\).\n\nGiven the initial value of the white daisies (\\(A_{w0}=0.01\\)), \\(dt=0.1\\) and the constants in Section 3.8 can you calculate the value of the daisies after one timestep (\\(A_{w1}\\))?\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Modelling Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM1\nCreate a loop that can help you generate the data (\\(A_{w1}, A_{w2}, A_{w_3}, ...\\)) for a specific number of timesteps (you may start with 50 iterations).\n\n\nM2\nPlot the graph of daisy coverage (\\(A_w\\)) against time (\\(t\\)) for white daisies.\n\n\nM3\nRepeat for black daisies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint: You may find that referring to the white daisy feedback loop may help with understanding how to update the variables.\n\nDo you remember Loops?\n\n\n\n3.2.3 HOW DOES THE PLANET TEMPERATURE CHANGE WITH TIME?\nNow, we are interested in planet temperature. However, similar to daisy coverage, we do not have a direct simple equation that links the planet temperature with time. Identify the main equation in the paper that shows the change in temperature.\nLooking at the equation, what variable(s) are changing with time ?\n\n\n3.2.4 Modelling Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM4\nBy making small changes to the previous code, plot the planet temperature against time.\n\n\nM5\nVary the initial amount of white daisies (\\(A_{w0}\\)), can you reach a steady state for the planet temperature (\\(T_p\\)) without killing all the daisies ? If so, give the final steady state conditions (\\(T_p\\) and \\(A_w\\)). How many steady states can you find?\n\n\nM6\nRepeat with black daisies only\n\n\nM7\nNow compare the result of the two types of daisies (Temperature vs time and the change in daisy population vs time for the same luminosity), do they reach the same result? And behave the same way to moderate T? Explain."

However, unlike the one-daisy case, there are now two different rates of change of area that direct how to evolve the system, namely,\n\ntells us where to go in the \\(A_b\\)-direction (taken to be the horizontal axis)\ntells us where to go in the \\(A_w\\)-direction (taken to be the vertical axis)\n\nWe may therefore define a vector \\(v\\) that consists of two components: magnitude of in the \\(A_b\\)-direction, and magnitude of in the \\(A_w\\)-direction.\n\n\n3.5.4 Modelling Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM24\nWhat do \\(v_b\\) and \\(v_w\\) represent ?\n\n\nM25\nWhat is the difference between the previous plot (with one daisy) and this 2D plot (stream plot)?\n\n\nM26\nPick several different starting positions and trace how the points move in the state space.
