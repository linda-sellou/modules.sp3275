    "text": "1.1 INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1.1 The Carbon cycle\nCarbon as water is also essential for life. It is the central element of organic molecules and in climate (\\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\)). The carbon cycle links the carbon in organic, atmospheric, oceanic, mantle and rocks. The resulting balance supports life and climate stability.\nDespite the luminosity of the sun increasing, the continents moving, ice age and warm periods occuring, life changing and oxygen appearing, the temperature of the Earth remained between 0\\(\\circ\\)C and 100\\(\\circ\\) C. The amount of \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) in the atmosphere is small compared to the carbon present in surface sediments as \\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\) and organic molecules. The key role in climate stability is the partitioning between \\(\\ce{CO2(g)}\\) and \\(\\ce{C(s)}\\).\n\n\n1.1.2 Reservoirs of carbon\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The Carbon cycle: Dynamics between carbon reservoirs.The fluxes are in GT per year.

Reservoirs for the inorganic carbon are: atmosphere, oceans, sediments and sedimentary rocks (limestone and dolostones).\nOceans are a key player in the system; they are sources as well as sinks for \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\). At equilibrium \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) flux from sources is balanced by sinks. However, when the equilibrium is disturbed like fossil fuels burning, most of the oceans are sinks for \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) (check how the tropical Pacific ocean behaves like a carbon source research.noaa.gov)."

How can you explain the locations of the carbon sinks and sources?\nWhat factors and how do they affect \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) solubility in water?\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Chemical weathering\nThe slightly acidic water reacts with crustal rock minerals like carbonates and silicates and cause weathering (carbonate weathering Equation 1.5 and silicate weathering Equation 1.6):\n\\[\n\\ce{CaCO3(s) + H2CO3(aq) -&gt; Ca^{2+} (aq)  + 2 HCO3- (aq)}\n\\tag{1.5}\\]\n\\[\n\\ce{CaSiO3(s) + 2 H2CO3(aq) -&gt; Ca^{2+} (aq)  + 2 HCO3- (aq) + SiO2(s) + H2O}\n\\tag{1.6}\\]\nAll the products are transported to rivers and then oceans. Most particulate materials are deposited near mouths of rivers in deltas, beaches, and near shores. The dissolved materials are distributed over the oceans.\n\nQuick Check 1.1 Does the concentration of salts in oceans increase versus time?\n\n\nSome of the calcium ions react with hydrogencarbonate to form calcium carbonate precipitate (Equation 1.7):\n\\[\n\\ce{ Ca^{2+} (aq)  + 2HCO3- (aq) -&gt; CaCO3(s) + H2CO3(aq) }\n\\tag{1.7}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Plankton\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Corals\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: :Marine organisms produce solid \\(\\ce{CaCO3}\\) and use \\(\\ce{SiO2}\\) to form their shells and skeletons. On the left, diatom and coccolithophorid are phytoplankton and foraminifer and radiolarian are zooplankton. Corals (on the right) are invertebrates using aragonite carbonates.\n\n\nThe formation of carbonic acid promotes the diffusion of \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) from oceans to the atmosphere. The precipitation of calcium carbonate (calcite and aragonite) is mainly done by organisms such as phytoplankton and zooplankton (corals make aragonite). \\(\\ce{SiO2}\\) is also used by plankton like diatom and radiolarian ( Figure 1.4). Read more about plankton on this website: The plankton Chronicles.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Density of calcium carbonate on ocean seafloors.\n\n\nWhat happens when the organisms die? From Figure 1.5, explain why there is high carbonate density at these geographical locations.\n\n\nWhat factors and how do they affect carbonate dissolution?\nDo carbonates behave the same as other minerals? Why?\n\n\n\nNotes to Myself {-}\nWhat will happen to the CCD with increasing carbon emission? %Their carbonate skeletons fall to the seafloor (if not dissolved) and become a part of the sediments (fig. \\(\\ref{fig-carbonate-sediment}\\)). Eventually, by seafloor spreading the sediments are carried to depth and buried. They become limestone reservoirs.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Silicate weathering net process\nCarbonate weathering Equation 1.5 is balanced out by carbonate precipitation Equation 1.7 and no net of \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) is produced. Silica weathering Equation 1.8 is combined only with carbonate precipitation Equation 1.9 and carbon dioxide in water Equation 1.10. The overall reaction Equation 1.11 shows a net conversion of atmospheric \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) to solid \\(\\ce{CaCO3(s)}\\) i.e. a net outflow of \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) from the atmosphere reservoir to the ocean.\n\\[\n\\ce{CaSiO_3(s)  + 2H2CO3(aq) -&gt; Ca^{2+}(aq)  + 2HCO3^-(aq) + SiO2(s) + H2O}\n\\tag{1.8}\\]\n\\[        \n\\ce{Ca^{2+} (aq) + 2 HCO3^-(aq) -&gt; CaCO3(s) + H2CO3(aq)}\n\\tag{1.9}\\]\n\\[\n\\ce{CO2 + H2O &lt;=&gt; H2CO3(aq)}\n\\tag{1.10}\\]\n\\[        \n\\ce {CaSiO_3(s) + CO2 -&gt; CaCO3(s)  + SiO2(s)}\n\\tag{1.11}\\]\nThe silicate weathering rate increases with temperature and with rain (water is the reaction medium).\nAlthough the conversion rate is small (0.03 Gton(C)/year), it is significant to cause carbon depletion in the atmosphere over one million years. This means there is a need for a return flux to the atmosphere: The carbonate-silicate geochemical cycle."

Is the rate of volcanism affected by \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) or by the climate at the surface of the Earth?\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: The global inorganic carbon cycle.\n\n\nThe key in the regulation of \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) on long time scales (i.e. million years) is the feedback between the climate and the rate of silicate weathering. The climatic factors responsive of silicate weathering and of the concentration of \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) are the temperature and the net rainfall. An increase in temperature or rainfall increases silicate weathering. The negative feedback loop regulates and stabilizes \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) and hence the climate on long time scales.\nWhat are negative feedback loops? A negative feedback loop is a process that counteracts changes in a system, helping to maintain stability. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 1.8, if a factor (known as a forcing) disrupts your body temperature, your body responds by initiating processes such as shivering or sweating. These responses work to bring your body temperature back to homeostasis (equilibrium).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.8: Negative feedback loop: An example of how the body regulates its temperature\n\n\n\nDo you know any other biological feedback loops?\n\n\n\nQuestion 1.2 Draw the negative feedback loop connecting surface temperature, silicate weathering rate, atmospheric \\(\\textcolor{black}{\\ce{CO2}}\\) and greenhouse effect.

This method is crucial for tracing the history of organic remains within the carbon cycle.\nAdditionally, radioactive isotopes like Carbon-14 act as geotracers in studying ocean circulation patterns, such as the global conveyor belt. These geotracers help us track the movement of water masses over long timescales, offering insights into ocean dynamics and climate regulation.\nMoreover, Carbon-14 can also serve as a biomarker, helping us detect the presence of life by identifying organic materials in ancient samples.\nFurther instructions will be shared with a Python notebook."
